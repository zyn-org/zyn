/// Writes all the provided buffers to an asynchronous writer using vectored I/O.

/// buffers are completely written or an error occurs.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `bufs` - A mutable slice of IoSlice references containing the data to write
/// * `writer` - A mutable reference to the writer implementing AsyncWrite and AsyncWriteExt
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(())` - When all buffers have been successfully written
/// * `Err(_)` - When a write operation fails or returns zero bytes written
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function returns an error if:
/// - Any write operation returns an underlying I/O error
/// - A write operation returns 0 bytes written (indicating a closed connection)
