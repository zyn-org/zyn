## Overview

The Narwhal protocol is designed for scalable pub/sub communication. It provides a low-level messaging infrastructure that can be extended with a custom application protocol through a **modulator**.

The protocol supports three types of connections:

1. **Client-to-Server (C2S)**: End-user clients connecting to the Narwhal server
2. **Server-to-Modulator (S2M)**: Server-initiated connection to the modulator for delegating application-specific operations
3. **Modulator-to-Server (M2S)**: Modulator-initiated connection for sending direct messages to clients

### What is a Modulator?

A modulator is an external service that implements a custom application protocol on top of Narwhal's messaging layer. Rather than embedding application logic in the server, Narwhal delegates these concerns to a single modulator, keeping the core server lightweight and focused on message routing.

**Important**: Each Narwhal server instance connects to exactly **one modulator**. This design ensures consistent application protocol semantics and simplifies the architecture.

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Custom Authentication**: Implement JWT validation, OAuth flows, or proprietary auth schemes
- **Authorization & Access Control**: Define complex permission rules beyond basic channel ACLs
- **Content Validation**: Enforce message schemas, size limits, or content policies
- **Message Transformation**: Encrypt, compress, or enrich messages before delivery
- **Business Logic**: Implement game logic, chat moderation, presence systems, or any application-specific features
- **Integration**: Bridge Narwhal with external services, databases, or APIs
- **Analytics**: Track user behavior, message patterns, or system metrics

The modulator operates independently and can be written in any language, scaled separately, and updated without affecting the core Narwhal server.

### Why a custom protocol?

Narwhal implements a custom TCP-based protocol rather than leveraging existing protocols like HTTP or MQTT. This decision was made deliberately to optimize for the specific requirements of real-time pub/sub messaging while maintaining simplicity and flexibility.

**Key Design Rationale:**

1. **Fine-grained Control**: A custom protocol gives us complete control over every aspect of the wire format, allowing us to optimize for our exact use case. We can minimize overhead, eliminate unnecessary features, and ensure predictable behavior for real-time messaging patterns.

2. **Simplicity Through Constraint**: The protocol intentionally avoids complex features like nested types or recursive data structures. Message parameters are flat, consisting of simple scalar values (strings, integers) with optional binary payloads. This constraint makes the protocol easier to implement, debug, and reason about, while still providing all the functionality needed for pub/sub messaging.

3. **Efficiency Without Complexity**: By avoiding nested types and keeping message structures flat, we eliminate the need for complex parsing and serialization logic. This reduces CPU overhead, memory allocations, and latency—critical factors for real-time systems handling thousands of concurrent connections.

4. **Hybrid Design for Future Flexibility**: The protocol uses a hybrid approach with text-based message headers and binary payloads. This provides excellent debuggability during development (text headers are human-readable over the wire) while maintaining efficiency for payload delivery. Importantly, this design can be trivially migrated to a fully binary protocol if needed—the text headers can be replaced with binary-encoded message types and length-prefixed parameters without changing the protocol's semantics.

5. **Tailored Message Flow**: Generic protocols often impose constraints that don't align with our needs. For example, HTTP's request-response model doesn't naturally support bidirectional streaming or server-initiated messages. By building our own protocol, we can design message flows that perfectly match the pub/sub domain: connection handshakes, channel subscriptions, broadcasts, and modulator delegation.

6. **Predictable Performance**: With full control over the protocol, we can guarantee consistent performance characteristics. There are no hidden features, no protocol negotiation surprises, and no compatibility concerns with different protocol versions from various vendors. This predictability is crucial for production systems with strict latency requirements.

7. **Evolution Path**: The protocol's versioning mechanism (`CONNECT` message includes protocol version) gives us explicit control over evolution. We can introduce breaking changes through version negotiation rather than being constrained by backward compatibility requirements of established protocols.

## Preliminaries

### Network

Narwhal uses a hybrid protocol over TCP with text-based message framing and binary payloads. The protocol defines all messages as request-response pairs or server-initiated notifications. Message headers are newline-delimited text consisting of a message name followed by space-separated parameters. Messages that include payloads (indicated by a `length` parameter) are followed by binary data.

The client initiates a socket connection and then writes a sequence of request messages and reads back the corresponding response messages. A handshake is required upon connection to establish protocol parameters and capabilities.

The server guarantees that on a single TCP connection, requests will be processed in the order they are sent, and responses will return in that order as well. However, the protocol supports multiple in-flight requests through a correlation ID mechanism, allowing clients to pipeline requests without waiting for each response.

The server has a configurable maximum limit on message size (`max_message_size`) and payload size (`max_payload_size`), communicated during connection establishment. Any message that exceeds these limits will result in an error or connection termination.

**Transport Layer Requirements:**

- **TCP**: All Narwhal connections use TCP for reliable, ordered delivery
- **TLS**: Mandatory for client-to-server (C2S) connections to protect authentication tokens and message content. For modulator connections (M2S/S2M), plain TCP or Unix domain sockets are supported
- **Port**: Configurable, but clients must know the server's port to connect
- **Encoding**: Messages use UTF-8 text encoding for parameters, with binary payloads transmitted as opaque byte sequences

### Connection Management

Narwhal supports three types of connections, each with its own lifecycle:

**Client-To-Server Connections (C2S)**:
- Initiated by clients using [CONNECT](#connect)
- May require authentication via [IDENTIFY](#identify) and [AUTH](#auth)
- Long-lived connections for ongoing message exchange
- Support heartbeat via [PING](#ping)/[PONG](#pong)
- Clients should reconnect with exponential backoff on disconnection

**Server-To-Modulator Connections (S2M)**:
- Initiated by the server using [S2M_CONNECT](#s2m_connect)
- Authenticate via shared secret
- Server delegates operations to the modulator
- Modulator declares supported operations in [S2M_CONNECT_ACK](#s2m_connect_ack)

**Modulator-To-Server Connections (M2S)**:
- Initiated by the modulator using [M2S_CONNECT](#m2s_connect)
- Authenticate via shared secret
- Used by modulator to send direct messages to clients

**Connection Persistence:**

Narwhal is designed for persistent connections. Clients and modulators should:
- Maintain long-lived TCP connections rather than connecting per-request
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Send periodic heartbeats at the negotiated `heartbeat_interval` to detect dead connections
- Gracefully handle connection closures by attempting to reconnect

**Connection Limits:**

The server enforces the following limits, communicated during connection establishment:
- `max_inflight_requests`: Maximum number of concurrent outstanding requests per connection
- `max_subscriptions`: Maximum number of channels a client can join (client connections only)
- `max_message_size`: Maximum size of a protocol message in bytes
- `max_payload_size`: Maximum size of a binary payload in bytes

### Message Ordering and Flow Control

**Request-Response Ordering:**

The Narwhal protocol guarantees that messages on a single TCP connection are processed in the order they are received. However, the protocol supports request pipelining through correlation IDs:

- Clients can send multiple requests without waiting for responses
- Each request that expects a response includes an `id` parameter (u32, 1-4294967295)
- Responses include the same `id` to correlate with the original request
- The server may process requests concurrently but returns responses in any order
- Clients must track outstanding requests by their correlation IDs

**Flow Control:**

The `max_inflight_requests` parameter limits the number of concurrent outstanding requests:
- Clients must not send more than `max_inflight_requests` requests before receiving responses
- This prevents overwhelming the server and provides backpressure
- Exceeding this limit may result in errors or connection termination

**Server-Initiated Messages:**

Some messages are sent by the server without a corresponding client request:
- [MESSAGE](#message): Broadcast messages from channels
- [MOD_DIRECT](#mod_direct): Direct messages (when initiated by modulator)
- [EVENT](#event): Channel events (member join/leave)
- [ERROR](#error): Errors without correlation IDs (connection-level errors)

These messages do not have correlation IDs, and are delivered asynchronously.

**Heartbeat:**

Both clients and modulators must implement heartbeat to detect dead connections:
- Send [PING](#ping) messages at the negotiated `heartbeat_interval`
- Server responds with [PONG](#pong) containing the same correlation ID
- Missing heartbeats (typically 2-3 intervals) indicate a dead connection
- Clients should close and reconnect when heartbeats fail

### Versioning and Compatibility

The Narwhal protocol is designed to enable incremental evolution in a backward-compatible fashion. Versioning is done at the connection level, with each connection negotiating a protocol version during the initial handshake.

**Version Negotiation:**

All connections begin with a version negotiation:
- Client sends [CONNECT](#connect) with `version` parameter indicating the protocol version it supports
- Server responds with [CONNECT_ACK](#connect_ack) accepting the connection or [ERROR](#error) with `UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
- If accepted, both parties communicate using the negotiated protocol version for the lifetime of the connection
- Similar negotiation occurs for modulator connections via [M2S_CONNECT](#m2s_connect)/[S2M_CONNECT](#s2m_connect)

**Version Semantics:**

- **Version 1**: Initial protocol specification (current version)
- Future versions will maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Breaking changes will require a new major version number
- The server may support multiple protocol versions simultaneously
- Clients must specify the exact version they implement

**Compatibility Strategy:**

The intended upgrade path is:
1. New protocol versions are first deployed on servers
2. Servers continue to support older protocol versions for backward compatibility
3. Clients are gradually updated to use newer protocol versions
4. Old protocol versions are deprecated after a transition period

**Modulator Operations:**

The modulator declares supported operations in its [S2M_CONNECT_ACK](#s2m_connect_ack) response:
- `operations`: Array of operation names the modulator supports (e.g., `auth`, `fwd-broadcast-payload`, etc.)
- The server adapts its behavior based on supported operations
- If `auth` is not supported, clients must use [IDENTIFY](#identify) instead of authenticated [AUTH](#auth)
- This allows modulators to implement only the features they need

**Error Handling:**

Version mismatches and unsupported features result in errors:
- `UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION`: Client's protocol version is not supported by the server
- `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`: Requested feature is not implemented
- Clients should handle these errors gracefully and either retry with a different version or inform the user

## Protocol

### Identifiers

#### NID (Narwhal ID)

A NID is a unique identifier for users and servers in the format `username@domain`.

- **Client NID**: `username@domain` (e.g., `alice@example.com`)
- **Server NID**: `domain` (e.g., `example.com`) - used when username is empty

**Validation Rules:**
- Username must be alphanumeric with hyphens, dots, or underscores
- Username maximum length: 256 characters
- Domain must be a valid domain name, IPv4, IPv6, or `localhost`
- Domain maximum length: 253 characters

#### ChannelId

A ChannelId identifies a communication channel in the format `!handler@domain`.

- Format: `!{handler}@{domain}` (e.g., `!abc123@example.com`)
- Handler is a non-empty alphanumeric string (up to 256 characters)
- Handler must contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- Domain follows the same validation rules as NID domains

### Message Structure

Messages in the Narwhal protocol follow a text-based format:

```
MESSAGE_NAME param1=value1 param2=value2 param3:2=value1,value2
```

- Message names are uppercase ASCII strings
- Parameters are space-separated key-value pairs
- Array parameters use the format `name:count=value1 value2 ...`
- Values with whitespace are escaped using delimiters (`\"`, `\'`, `\:`, or `\*`)

### Connection Types

#### Client Connection Flow

1. Client sends [CONNECT](#connect)
2. Server responds with [CONNECT_ACK](#connect_ack)
3. If auth required:
   - If modulator doesn't support `auth` operation:
     - Client sends [IDENTIFY](#identify) to register username
     - Server responds with [IDENTIFY_ACK](#identify_ack)
   - Client sends [AUTH](#auth)
   - Server responds with [AUTH_ACK](#auth_ack) (delegated to modulator if it supports `auth`)
4. Client can now send operational messages

#### Server-to-Modulator Connection Flow (S2M)

1. Server sends [S2M_CONNECT](#s2m_connect)
2. Modulator responds with [S2M_CONNECT_ACK](#s2m_connect_ack) with supported operations
3. Server can now delegate operations like authentication, event processing, and payload handling to the modulator

#### Modulator Connection Flow (M2S)

1. Modulator sends [M2S_CONNECT](#m2s_connect)
2. Server responds with [M2S_CONNECT_ACK](#m2s_connect_ack)
3. Modulator can now send direct messages and handle application logic

## Client-To-Server Messages

### CONNECT

Initiates a connection to the Narwhal server.

**Direction**: Client → Server

**Parameters**:
- `version` (u16, required): Protocol version number (must be non-zero)
- `heartbeat_interval` (u32, optional): Requested heartbeat interval in milliseconds (0 = no heartbeat)

**Example**:
```
CONNECT version=1 heartbeat_interval=30000
```

---

### CONNECT_ACK

Acknowledges a connection request and provides server capabilities.

**Direction**: Server → Client

**Parameters**:
- `auth_required` (bool, required): Whether authentication is required
- `application_protocol` (string, optional): Application-specific protocol identifier
- `heartbeat_interval` (u32, required): Server-assigned heartbeat interval in milliseconds
- `max_subscriptions` (u32, required): Maximum number of channels a client can join
- `max_message_size` (u32, required): Maximum size of a message in bytes
- `max_payload_size` (u32, required): Maximum size of a payload in bytes
- `max_inflight_requests` (u32, required): Maximum number of concurrent requests

**Example**:
```
CONNECT_ACK auth_required=true heartbeat_interval=30000 max_subscriptions=100 max_message_size=4096 max_payload_size=1048576 max_inflight_requests=10
```

---

### IDENTIFY

Registers a username with the server.

**Direction**: Client → Server

**Parameters**:
- `username` (string, required): Desired username (must be non-empty)

**Example**:
```
IDENTIFY username=alice
```

**Note**: IDENTIFY is required when the configured modulator (if any) doesn't support the `auth` operation type. In such cases, the server cannot delegate authentication to the modulator, so the client must first register a username via IDENTIFY. If a modulator with `auth` support is configured, IDENTIFY can be skipped and authentication will be delegated to the modulator.

---

### IDENTIFY_ACK

Confirms username registration and provides the full NID.

**Direction**: Server → Client

**Parameters**:
- `nid` (string, required): The assigned NID (must be non-empty)

**Example**:
```
IDENTIFY_ACK nid=alice@example.com
```

---

### AUTH

Authenticates the client using a token. Authentication is only supported when a modulator is configured and supports the `auth` operation. In this case, the server delegates token validation to the modulator via [S2M_AUTH](#s2m_auth). If no modulator with `auth` support is configured, clients must use [IDENTIFY](#identify) instead to register a username, and the AUTH message serves no authentication purpose.

**Direction**: Client → Server

**Parameters**:
- `token` (string, required): Authentication token (must be non-empty)

**Example**:
```
AUTH token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Note**: Authentication is only possible when a modulator with `auth` support is configured. In this case, the modulator determines the username. Without a modulator supporting `auth`, the username must be set via [IDENTIFY](#identify) and no real authentication occurs.

---

### AUTH_ACK

Acknowledges an authentication attempt. If a modulator with `auth` support is configured, this response is based on the modulator's [S2M_AUTH_ACK](#s2m_auth_ack) response. Without such a modulator, this is simply an acknowledgment without actual authentication.

**Direction**: Server → Client

**Parameters**:
- `challenge` (string, optional): Challenge string for additional authentication steps
- `succeeded` (bool, optional): Whether authentication succeeded
- `nid` (string, optional): The authenticated user's NID

**Example**:
```
AUTH_ACK succeeded=true nid=alice@example.com
```

**Note**: When a modulator with `auth` support is configured, the `nid` is constructed from the `username` provided by the modulator in [S2M_AUTH_ACK](#s2m_auth_ack) combined with the server's domain.

---

### JOIN

```

---

### LEAVE_ACK

Acknowledges a channel leave request.

**Direction**: Server → Client

**Parameters**:
- `id` (u32, required): Request identifier matching the LEAVE message (must be non-zero)

**Example**:

**Direction**: Client → Server

**Parameters**:
- `id` (u32, required): Request identifier (must be non-zero)
- `channel` (string, required): Target channel ID (must be non-empty)
- `qos` (u8, optional): Quality of Service level (defaults to 1 if not specified)
  - `0`: Acknowledge as soon as the payload is received
  - `1`: Acknowledge when the payload has been enqueued for delivery to all channel members
- `length` (u32, required): Payload size in bytes (must be non-zero)

**Example**:
```
BROADCAST id=3 channel=!42@example.com qos=1 length=1024
[1024 bytes of binary payload follow]
```

---

### BROADCAST_ACK

Acknowledges a broadcast message. The timing of this acknowledgment depends on the QoS level specified in the BROADCAST message:
- QoS 0: Sent immediately when the payload is received
- QoS 1: Sent after the payload has been enqueued for delivery to all channel members

**Direction**: Server → Client

**Parameters**:
- `id` (u32, required): Request identifier matching the BROADCAST message (must be non-zero)

**Example**:

## Protocol Flow Examples

### Example 1: Basic Client Connection and Channel Join

```
Client → Server: CONNECT version=1 heartbeat_interval=30000
Server → Client: CONNECT_ACK auth_required=true heartbeat_interval=30000 max_subscriptions=100 max_message_size=4096 max_payload_size=1048576 max_inflight_requests=10

Client → Server: IDENTIFY username=alice
Server → Client: IDENTIFY_ACK nid=alice@example.com

Client → Server: AUTH token=abc123token
Server → Client: AUTH_ACK succeeded=true nid=alice@example.com

Client → Server: JOIN id=1 channel=!42@example.com
Server → Client: JOIN_ACK id=1 channel=!42@example.com
Server → Client: EVENT kind=MEMBER_JOINED channel=!42@example.com nid=alice@example.com owner=false
```

### Example 2: Broadcasting a Message

```
Client → Server: BROADCAST id=5 channel=!42@example.com length=13
Client → Server: [payload: "Hello, World!"]
Server → Client: BROADCAST_ACK id=5

[Server forwards to all channel members]
Server → Other Clients: MESSAGE from=alice@example.com channel=!42@example.com length=13
Server → Other Clients: [payload: "Hello, World!"]
```

### Example 3a: Authentication with Modulator Support

When a modulator supports the `auth` operation, it handles authentication and provides the username:

```
Server → Modulator: S2M_CONNECT version=1 secret=server-secret heartbeat_interval=30000
Modulator → Server: S2M_CONNECT_ACK application_protocol=myapp-v1 operations:2=auth fwd-broadcast-payload heartbeat_interval=30000 max_inflight_requests=50 max_message_size=8192 max_payload_size=4194304

[Client connects and authenticates directly without IDENTIFY]
Client → Server: CONNECT version=1 heartbeat_interval=30000
Server → Client: CONNECT_ACK auth_required=true heartbeat_interval=30000 max_subscriptions=100 max_message_size=4096 max_payload_size=1048576 max_inflight_requests=10

Client → Server: AUTH token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Server → Modulator: S2M_AUTH id=1 token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Modulator → Server: S2M_AUTH_ACK id=1 username=alice succeeded=true
Server → Client: AUTH_ACK succeeded=true nid=alice@example.com

[Client can now send direct messages to the modulator]
Client → Server: MOD_DIRECT id=1 from=alice@example.com length=20
Client → Server: [payload: "APP_SPECIFIC_REQUEST"]
Server → Modulator: S2M_MOD_DIRECT id=2 from=alice@example.com length=20
Server → Modulator: [payload: "APP_SPECIFIC_REQUEST"]
Modulator → Server: S2M_MOD_DIRECT_ACK id=2 valid=true
```

### Example 3b: Authentication without Modulator Auth Support

When a modulator doesn't support the `auth` operation, clients must use IDENTIFY first:

```
Server → Modulator: S2M_CONNECT version=1 secret=server-secret heartbeat_interval=30000
Modulator → Server: S2M_CONNECT_ACK application_protocol=myapp-v1 operations:1=fwd-broadcast-payload heartbeat_interval=30000 max_inflight_requests=50 max_message_size=8192 max_payload_size=4194304

[Client connects and must identify before authenticating]
Client → Server: CONNECT version=1 heartbeat_interval=30000
Server → Client: CONNECT_ACK auth_required=true heartbeat_interval=30000 max_subscriptions=100 max_message_size=4096 max_payload_size=1048576 max_inflight_requests=10

Client → Server: IDENTIFY username=alice
Server → Client: IDENTIFY_ACK nid=alice@example.com

Client → Server: AUTH token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
[Server does not validate token - no authentication occurs without modulator auth support]
Server → Client: AUTH_ACK succeeded=true nid=alice@example.com
```

### Example 4: Error Handling

```
Client → Server: JOIN id=2 channel=!999@example.com
Server → Client: ERROR id=2 reason=CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND detail=\:Channel !999@example.com does not exist\:
```

## Wire Format Details

### Parameter Encoding

Parameters are encoded as space-separated key-value pairs:

- **Simple values**: `key=value`
- **String values with whitespace**: Escaped using one of `\"`, `\'`, `\:`, or `\*`
  - Example: `detail=\:This is a message with spaces\:`
- **Empty strings**: `key=\"\"`
- **Boolean values**: `key=true` or `key=false`
- **Numeric values**: `key=123`
- **Array values**: `key:count=value1 value2 ...`
  - Example: `members:3=alice@example.com bob@example.com charlie@example.com`

### Message Format

```
MESSAGE_NAME[ param1=value1][ param2=value2]...\n
[optional binary payload]
```

- Message name is uppercase ASCII (text)
- Parameters are optional and space-separated (text)
- Message header ends with a newline character (`\n`)
- If the message includes a payload (indicated by a `length` parameter), the binary payload immediately follows the newline
- Payloads are opaque binary data, not text-encoded

### Payload Messages

The following messages include binary payloads:

- [BROADCAST](#broadcast) / [MESSAGE](#message)
- [MOD_DIRECT](#mod_direct) / [M2S_MOD_DIRECT](#m2s_mod_direct) / [S2M_MOD_DIRECT](#s2m_mod_direct)
- [S2M_FORWARD_BROADCAST_PAYLOAD](#s2m_forward_broadcast_payload) / [S2M_FORWARD_BROADCAST_PAYLOAD_ACK](#s2m_forward_broadcast_payload_ack) (when `altered_payload=true`)

The payload immediately follows the message parameters without any additional framing.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- **Client Authentication**: Only supported when a modulator is configured with `auth` operation support
  - Clients with modulator auth: Use [AUTH](#auth) message with a token, validated by modulator via [S2M_AUTH](#s2m_auth)
  - Clients without modulator auth: Use [IDENTIFY](#identify) to register a username (no actual authentication occurs)
- **Modulator Authentication**: Modulators authenticate to the server using a shared secret in [M2S_CONNECT](#m2s_connect) or [S2M_CONNECT](#s2m_connect)
- **Transport Security**:
  - Client connections (C2S) **must** use TLS to protect authentication tokens and message content
  - Modulator connections (M2S/S2M) can use plain TCP or Unix domain sockets since they typically run in trusted environments

### Authorization

- Channel access is controlled through ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- ACLs specify which NID patterns can join, publish, and read from channels
- The `on_behalf` parameter in [JOIN](#join) and [LEAVE](#leave) allows privileged users to manage other users' channel memberships

### Rate Limiting

- Servers enforce limits through configuration parameters:
  - `max_inflight_requests`: Limits concurrent outstanding requests
  - `max_message_size`: Limits individual message size
  - `max_payload_size`: Limits payload size
  - `max_subscriptions`: Limits number of channels per client

### Application Protocol Integration

- A single modulator provides the custom application protocol layer on top of Narwhal's messaging infrastructure
- The [S2M_FORWARD_BROADCAST_PAYLOAD](#s2m_forward_broadcast_payload) flow allows payload validation, transformation, or enrichment
- [MOD_DIRECT](#mod_direct) / [M2S_MOD_DIRECT](#m2s_mod_direct) / [S2M_MOD_DIRECT](#s2m_mod_direct) enable bidirectional application-specific communication
- The modulator can implement custom authorization, content policies, message routing, or any other application logic
- Each Narwhal server connects to exactly one modulator, ensuring consistent application semantics across all clients

## Implementation Notes

### Message Correlation

Messages that expect responses use an `id` parameter for correlation:
- The `id` must be unique among inflight requests from the same connection
- Responses include the same `id` to match requests
- `id` is a 16-bit unsigned integer (1-65535, 0 is reserved)

### Heartbeat

- Clients and modulators should send [PING](#ping) messages at the negotiated `heartbeat_interval`
- Servers respond with [PONG](#pong) messages
- Missing heartbeats may result in connection termination

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Handshake**: Establish connection parameters and capabilities
2. **Authentication**: Verify identity (if required)
3. **Operations**: Perform channel operations and message exchange
4. **Teardown**: Graceful disconnection or error-based termination

### Error Recovery

- Recoverable errors allow clients to retry or adjust their requests
- Non-recoverable errors typically require reconnection
- Clients should implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

## Version History

- **Version 1.1** (December 2025):
  - Changed ChannelId handler from numeric (u32) to alphanumeric string (up to 256 characters)
  - Made `channel` parameter required in JOIN message (previously optional for dynamic channel creation)
  - Updated S2M_FORWARD_BROADCAST_PAYLOAD `channel` parameter from u32 to alphanumeric string
- **Version 1**: Initial protocol specification
